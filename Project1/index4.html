				<h2> Aerospace Scientist</h2>
				<p><b>S. Nambi Narayananb</b>(born 12 December 1941) is an Indian aerospace scientist, 
				who worked for the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and contributed significantly to Indian 
				space program by developing the Vikas rocket engine. He led the team which acquired technology from the French 
				for the Vikas engine used in the first PSLV that India launched. As a senior official at the Indian Space Research 
				Organisation (ISRO), he was in-charge of the cryogenics division. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan,
				India's third-highest civilian award, in March 2019.In 1994, he was arrested on trumped up charges of espionage,
				being subjected to physical abuse while in the custody of the Kerala Police. 
				The charges against him were found to be baseless by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in April 1996.
				As a result, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all charges against him and prohibited the Government of Kerala
				from continuing its investigation on technical grounds. In 2018, a Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice Dipak Misra,
				awarded Narayanan a compensation of ₹50 lakh (equivalent to ₹57 lakh or US$71,000 in 2020). Additionally,
				the Government of Kerala then awarded him further compensation to the tune of
				₹1.3 crore (equivalent to ₹1.5 crore or US$190,000 in 2020) in 2019.
				The film Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, based on his life, starring and directed by R. Madhavan, was released in July 2022.]
